## About the project

The client wanted their web page re-designed to be more user friendly and
responsive.

## Challenges

When I worked for New Element AS they used WordPress and the [Enfold
theme](https://themeforest.net/item/enfold-responsive-multipurpose-theme/4519990?ref=Kriesi)
to design webpages for their clients. The good thing with using this theme is
that it is instantly responsive and only needs a few tweaks to look good on any
device. The challenge with this is that since the web page consists of standard
building blocks in a column system, you're forced to be creative within a fixed
structure. You have to really know the theme to know what it can do, and what
limitations it has to make an interesting design that is unique to each client.
It is an interesting challenge to force your creativity within the confines of a
theme and make the theme work for your creativity and design.

## Solution

In this specific case we made a sales pitch website for the client. The design
was created directly in the browser, where the front page, menu and the
structure is finished and the client can get an overall feel of how the site
will look and feel. In this design I focused on the user having easy access to
the information they need. The company's phone number is in the header for easy
access for plumbing emergencies. There's only one, sticky, top-positioned menu
and it provides easy access wherever you are on the website. When you scroll
further down you will have an overview of what kind of products and service they
provide. When the design is accepted it will be completed and the website will
be online.
