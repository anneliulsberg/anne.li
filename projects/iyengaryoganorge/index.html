    <h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>

    <p>This was a school project for Iyengar Yoga Norway. They wanted a website that
informed about Iyengar Yoga in Norway, what Iyengar yoga is, where you could
learn it, and when you could sign up for courses.</p>

    <p>The project started with a customer brief, where we talked to them about their
needs and desires. We then continued to work on strategy, content production,
information architecture, and design research. This resulted in a design
document, that was presented to the customer on the progression meeting halfway
in the project. We had a week from the customer brief to the completion of the
project and presentation of our work to the customer. The customer would then
consider all concepts freely and could choose to use one, several or none of the
concepts in the final solution.</p>

    <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

    <p>In such a tight time frame it was challenging to keep track of all business
processes we were mandated to go through and then additionally be able to
deliver on the deadline. It was important to produce a high quality product in a
short amount of time. It was important to be able to convey the feeling of
balance, calm and in control design solution so that the experience of using the
site reflected the feeling of Iyengar yoga.</p>

    <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

    <p>The solution was a design in monochrome colors with nuances of aqua blue, which
creates a calm expression. The menu is easily accessible at the top of the
submenu for further exploration of the page. The site is also designed in a 960
grid to achieve balance and control of information. The solution appears to be
simple and hassle free to navigate around.</p>
