    <p>This was a school project where we would create an interactive installation to
the theme “connecting the virtual and the physical. “ The installation would
consist of a physical installation that was connected to a website. I decided to
designed a game in which you used a custom gamepad to play the game. I built and
programmed this gamepad using Arduino. The game is about a bee that flies from
flower to flower by remembering the colour of the flowers. The target audience
is children aged 2-5.</p>

    <p>How to make a game that is interesting and challenging, but not so difficult
that children might lose interest? Another challenge was to figure out what to
do with technology I had never worked with before. It was exciting to see what
Arduino could do, but it was hard to not bite off more than I could chew in the
time allotted for the project. Figuring out what I could undertake and complete
in the given timeframe was essential. The idea for the color game was clear, but
coming up with an enthusing game design was also an interesting challenge.</p>

    <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

    <p>The Florian Colour Game is a colorful and happy memory game with color and
sound. You follow Florian The Bee to collect nectar. The game has simple game
mechanics so it can easily be played by a child. When each game board is
completed, the melody created by collecting nectar is played. The game has many
development potentials, such as high scores, score summary between each board
and additional colors of the flowers and gamepad buttons.</p>
