## About the project

This was a school project for kinetic typography, to teach me how to communicate
information in a visual way.

## Challenges

In this project, it was important to deliver information in a simplified, visual
way, so keeping up with the dialogue was easy, while at the same time creating a
story.

## Solution

In the audio clip, there are four people talking together. I gave each person
its own visual identity, to make ​​it easier to recognize who is talking. The
visual identity of each person gives them a special personality, creating
interest and excitement that drives the sound clip forward and makes you want to
follow the rest of the story.
