## About the project

This was a school project where the goal was to present data in a clear,
contextual and relevant way. The infographic should show off the data in an
interesting way, but at the same time be easy to understand and uncluttered. We
were to choose what kind of theme we would present and the choice fell on my
World of Warcraft game time and subscription.

## Challenges

Since money and time spent is not much data, I had to give this an angle that
gave it more meaning. To make others interested in something as boring as how
much I've played World of Warcraft and what it has cost in time and money, I had
to square the data with something that was a huge contrast. A challenge was to
convey so much different information without making the message unclear or the
design cluttered.

## Solution

To get a unified expression of a variety of information, the design uses a main
color, in several different shades. For the World of Warcraft logo to integrate
with the rest of the design, the design colors were derived from the logo. This
worked great with the blue dominated designed with a flair of the complementary
color orange. For the information to be told uniformly and comprehensively, I
designed all icons myself. Combined, I think this conveyed the data in an
interesting and clear manner.
