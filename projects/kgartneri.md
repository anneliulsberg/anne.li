## About the project

This was a school project for Kjær Gartneri who wanted to renew their website to
promote the organic tomatoes they grow. A successful design could give them a
niche in the market as an exclusive and high end product.

## Challenges

It was important for the customer for the design to be warm and vivid,
reflecting life, sunlight, nature and working with soil. It was a challenge,
though, to merge this thinking into a design that was more refined and would
attract high end users without seeming cold and impersonal.

## Solution

The solution we developed was a stylish, but warm design, with the colors of
tomatoes and soil. A large part of the design was to use lots of pictures to
convey Kjær gartneri’s message of tender, organic tomatoes that taste absolutely
delicious.
