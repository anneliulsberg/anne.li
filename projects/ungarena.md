## Challenges

This was a newly started company and they did not have any design guide for
UngArena. They only knew they wanted to be interesting and not boring for their
target audience.

## Solution

Since their target audience are people from 12 - 25 years old I had to design
something that was not excluding anyone. The solution was using an illustration
and colors that was not gender or age specefic. I also used their logo colors in
the rollup to make it more recognisable.
